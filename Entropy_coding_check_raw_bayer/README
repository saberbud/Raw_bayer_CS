COMPINT (COMP_Q in paper) files:
COMPINTs from kernel [kx,ky,1,4] stored in CIkxky4 folder.
In each of these folders:
COMP_Q has 4 channels stored in COMPINT0,1,2,3 as f00ix.png files (ix=1-3 for the 3 examples in paper).
PNG is just a uint8 container of these integer arrays, no compression (when I save these arrays, compression_level = 0, and values-no-change-saving-and-reading checked as well).


Arithmetic coding tests based on Haojie's modules using arcode: test_CI_arcode_paper_RB_14bit.ipynb
This is very similar to the Huffman program above, and output compression ratios at the end of program as well.
A few differences:
A1. To go with Haojie's modules, uint8 integer array is transformed to int8 array for input (subtract 128, and data type conversion). See in code.
A2. There is no decoding in these tests. (If Haojie can provide an example of decoding separately or add here, that will be helpful.)

One can easily and directly run the ipynb programs in this master folder and compare with my results stored in the CIkxky4 folders.
